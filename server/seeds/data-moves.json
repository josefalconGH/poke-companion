If the user cannot pay the HP cost, this move will fail.  The doll takes damage as normal, using the user's stats and types, and will break when its HP reaches zero.  Self-inflicted damage from confusion or recoil is not absorbed.  Healing effects from opponents ignore the doll and heal the user as normal.  Moves that work based on the user's HP still do so; the doll's HP does not influence any move.  The doll will block major status effects, confusion, and flinching.  The effects of smelling salts and wake up slap do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate major status effect.  Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.  Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap berry.  magic coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.  It will also block acupressure, block, the curse effect of curse, dream eater, embargo, flatter, gastro acid, grudge, heal block, leech seed, lock on, mean look, mimic, mind reader, nightmare, pain split, psycho shift, spider web, sketch, swagger, switcheroo, trick, worry seed, and yawn.  A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.  The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.  The doll is passed on by baton pass.  It keeps its existing HP, but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.  All other effects work as normal.",

(Bit 1 is 1 if the IV is of the form `4n + 2` or `4n + 3`.  `x` is then 64 * Special Defense IV bit 1, plus 32 * Special Attack IV bit 1, etc.)  Power is always between 30 and 70, inclusive.  Average power is 49.5.  Type is given by `y * 15 / 63`, where `y` is similar to `x` above, except constructed from bit 0.  (Bit 0 is 1 if the IV is odd.)  The result is looked up in the following table.  Value | Type ----: | --------     0 | fighting     1 | flying     2 | poison     3 | ground     4 | rock     5 | bug     6 | ghost     7 | steel     8 | fire     9 | water    10 | grass    11 | electric    12 | psychic    13 | ice    14 | dragon    15 | dark  This move thus cannot be normal.

For the duration of this effect, the evasion of every Pokémon on the field is lowered by two stages.  Cancels the effects of bounce, fly, and sky drop.  Specifically, flying Pokémon and those with levitate or that have used magnet rise are no longer immune to ground attacks, arena trap, spikes, or toxic spikes.  bounce, fly, sky drop, high jump kick, jump kick, and splash cannot be used while this move is in effect.  *Bug*: If this move is used during a double or triple battle while Pokémon are under the effect of sky drop, Sky Drop's effect is not correctly canceled on its target, and it remains high in the air indefinitely.  As Sky Drop prevents the target from acting, the only way to subsequently remove it from the field is to faint it.",

If the user successfully used detect, endure, protect, quick guard, or wide guard on the last turn, this move has a 50% chance to fail.  lock on, mind reader, and no guard provide a (100 – accuracy)% chance for moves to break through this move.  This does not apply to one-hit KO moves (fissure, guillotine, horn drill, and sheer cold); those are always blocked by this move.  thunder during rain dance and blizzard during hail have a 30% chance to break through this move.  The following effects are not prevented by this move:  * acupressure from an ally * curse's curse effect * Delayed damage from doom desire and future sight; however, these moves will be prevented if they are used this turn * feint, which will also end this move's protection after it hits * imprison * perish song * shadow force * Moves that merely copy the user, such as transform or psych up  This move cannot be selected by assist or metronome.",
